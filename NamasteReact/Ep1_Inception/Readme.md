# Lecture 1: Inception

_In this lecture, we delve into fundamental concepts essential for understanding React development._

## Topics Covered

1. [**Emmet**](#emmet): Streamlining code writing and editing through shortcuts.
2. [**CDN (Content Delivery Network)**](#cdn-content-delivery-network): Enhancing website performance and reliability by distributing web content across servers.
3. [**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**](#cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing):
   - Understanding CORS in general web development.
   - Exploring CORS in React and ReactDOM.
4. [**React.createElement**](#reactcreateelement): Creating React elements programmatically.

---

### Emmet

- **Purpose**: Designed to accelerate coding processes by offering shortcuts for quick code expansion.
  
---

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- **Definition**: A network of distributed servers delivering web content to users based on geographical proximity.
- **Benefits**:
  - Speeds up content delivery.
  - Enhances website performance and reliability.

---

### React CDN

- **Usage**:
  - [React](https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js): Core React library for various platforms.
  - [ReactDOM](https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js): React library for DOM operations.

---

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- **Purpose**: Prevents unauthorized data access between different domains.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enforced by browsers to ensure scripts only request resources from the same domain.
  - Defines permissions for cross-origin requests through headers.

---

### CORS in React & ReactDOM

- **Security Feature**: Ensures secure handling of cross-origin requests, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.

---

### React.createElement

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "head-1" },
  "This is Heading1"
);
```

- **Usage**: Creates React elements programmatically.
- Supports arrays for multiple children.

---

### createRoot

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a root folder for rendering elements.
  
---

### render

```javascript
root.render(element);
```

- **Functionality**:
  - Converts React elements into HTML elements understandable by browsers.
  - Replaces existing elements in the root instead of appending new ones.

---

### Example: Creating Nested Elements

```javascript
const parent = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "This is H1"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "This is H2"),
  ])
);
```
