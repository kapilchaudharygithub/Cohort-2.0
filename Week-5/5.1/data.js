//? Why do you need React?
// not for static websites
// needed fro dynamic websits, these libraries ,make it easier to  DOM manipulation.

//? State
// An object that represents the current state of the app.
//It represents the dynamic things in yout  app (thaings that change)
//FOr example: the value of the counter

//? Component
// It is a reuadable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.

//? Re-rendering

//A state change that triggers a re-render .
//A re-render represents the actual dom being manipulated when the state changes.


//You ususally have to define all your components once and then all you have to update the state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app.


//? JSX
// jsx stands for javascript  xml . 
//  it is a  sytax extension for javascript , most commonly used with react, a popular js library for building user interfaces .
// jsx allows you to write  html-like code directly  within js. 
// this makes it easier to create and manage the user  interface in react applications.
